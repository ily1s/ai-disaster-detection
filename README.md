# 🚨 AI-Powered Disaster Detection from Social Media

## 📌 Introduction
Disasters strike unexpectedly, and early detection is crucial to saving lives. Our **AI-driven disaster detection system** leverages **social media data** (Twitter) to identify crisis events in real time. By using **NLP and machine learning**, we provide rapid alerts to emergency responders, governments, and humanitarian organizations.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Traditional disaster detection relies on **news media and official reports**, often leading to delays. Meanwhile, social media platforms **capture events as they happen**. However, distinguishing real disasters from fake news and irrelevant posts is a challenge. We solve this by using **AI-powered filtering and classification**.

## 📊 The Data
- **Source:** Twitter API (real-time tweets)  
- **Dataset:** Labeled tweets from past disasters (earthquakes, floods, fires)  
- **Features:** Text content, geolocation, timestamps  

## 💡 Solution Approach
1. **Data Collection** – Stream tweets using **Twitter API**, filtering disaster-related keywords.  
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Remove noise, extract relevant terms, and detect locations.  
3. **AI Model** – Fine-tuned **BERT model** to classify tweets as **disaster or non-disaster**.  
4. **Event Detection** – Analyze tweet frequency and patterns for real-time alerts.  
5. **Visualization Dashboard** – Display detected disasters on an interactive map.  

## 🚀 Results & Impact
✅ **High accuracy disaster classification using fine-tuned BERT**  
✅ **Fast response time** – Alerts generated within minutes of an event  
✅ **Interactive map** – Visual representation of disaster locations  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python, Flask** – Backend for API & data processing  
- **Tweepy** – Twitter API for real-time streaming  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – BERT for disaster classification  
- **Scikit-Learn, Pandas** – Data processing & machine learning  
- **Streamlit / Dash** – Interactive UI for alerts
